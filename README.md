Use the "Options" button to specify the connection settins to your bo and the refresh frequency (default is 60 seconds).

## Note

Actually "Trade history" table will be populated only if you are on freqtrade develop branch  https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/tree/develop . Should be available soon on master.
