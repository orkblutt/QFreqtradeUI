## Description

This GUI uses the freqtrade's REST API to monitor your trades and to use commands like "start"/"stop"/"stop buy" and so on.

## Usage

Click on the "Options" button to specify the connection settings to your bot and the refresh frequency (default is 60 seconds).
By default, clicking an action button will popup a message asking if you really want to continue. You can disable this message from the options dialog by checking "One click command".
